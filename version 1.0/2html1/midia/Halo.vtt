00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.250
Remember those walls I built?

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.150
Well, baby they're tumbling down

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.150
And they didn't even put up a fight

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.150
They didn't even make a sound

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.050
I found a way to let you in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.150
But, I never really had a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.150
Standing in the light of your halo

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250
I got my angel now

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.050
It's like I've been awakened

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.950
Every rule I had you breakin'

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.950
It's the risk that I'm taking

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.550
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.150
Everywhere I'm looking now

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250
I'm surrounded by your embrace

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.250
Baby, I can see your halo

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.150
You know you're my saving grace

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.150
You're everything I need and more

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.250
It's written all over your face

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.250
Baby, I can feel your halo

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.850
Pray it won't fade away

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.550
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.350
I can see your halo, halo, halo

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.350
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.550
I can see your halo, halo...

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.350
Halo, ooh ooh...

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.250
Hit me like a ray of sun

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.350
Burning through my darkest night

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.850
You're the only one that I want

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.150
Think I'm addicted to your light

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.150
I swore I'd never fall again

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.250
But this don't even feel like falling

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.250
Gravity can't forget to pull
me back to the ground again

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.050
And it's like I've been awakened

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.650
Every rule I had you breakin'

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.050
It's the risk that I'm taking

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.650
I'm never gonna shut you out!

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.050
Everywhere I'm looking now

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.250
I'm surrounded by your embrace

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.350
Baby, I can see your halo

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.550
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.450
