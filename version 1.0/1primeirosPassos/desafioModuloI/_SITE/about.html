        <h1>About me</h1>
            I'm in the process of transitioning to a career in technology. Currently, I'm studying ADS, Software Engineering, and the content from DIO.
            <br>
            <br>
            I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks, with a special focus on JavaScript, React, Node.js, Vue.js and Python.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love discussing books, games, and everything related to the geek universe. I'm always open to new connections and collaboration opportunities.
